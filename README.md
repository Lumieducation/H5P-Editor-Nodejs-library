# H5P-Nodejs-library

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Lumieducation/H5P-Nodejs-library/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Lumieducation/H5P-Nodejs-library/tree/master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Lumieducation/H5P-Nodejs-library/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Lumieducation/H5P-Nodejs-library?branch=master)

This library provides everything needed to create custom H5P servers running on NodeJS. It is written in TypeScript and fully typed, which makes it much easier to work with than the official PHP server. Of course, it's also possible to use this library in projects with JavaScript \(ES5\) and you will still profit from the typings by getting code completion in your IDE.

Even though the repository includes a sample demo project that demonstrates its functionality, it's still your job to integrate this library into your own NodeJS server. This is called an "implementation" or "plugin" in H5P terminology. The implementation is responsible for exposing HTTP endpoints, persisting data and calling maintenance functions. **This library is not an out-of-the-box solution to get a standalone H5P server.**

Please note that even if most functionality of H5P seems to work, **there are parts which haven't been implemented yet or which might be faulty.** This is particularly true for security concerns. For a more comprehensive list of what works and what doesn't, check out [the documentation page on the current status of the project](docs/status.md). The interfaces have reached some level of stability, but might still change in future major releases.

## Documentation

You can find all documentation pages in the [`docs`](https://github.com/Lumieducation/H5P-Private/tree/464ef52d4301efb9eb1f2f94203b55ef147ffac6/docs/README.md) directory or browse through them with these links as entry points:

## Trying out the demo

Make sure you have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/), [`node`](https://nodejs.org/)

> = 10.16, and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you use Windows, you must use bash \(comes with Git for windows\) as a command shell \(otherwise scripts won't run\).

1. Clone the repository with git
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

You can then open the URL [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in any browser.

## Trying out the demo on Docker

Make sure you have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) and [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

1. Clone the repository with git
2. `docker build -t <your-username>/h5p-nodejs-library .`
3. `docker run -p 3000:8080 -d <your-username>/h5p-nodejs-library`

You can then open the URL [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in any browser.
